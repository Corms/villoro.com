  Choosing between colors is always a difficult task, especially for people like me who are not very good a design tasks.

  I used to have a hard time every time I had to deal with colors. I allways felt that having a lot of names for the colors was not a practical solution. For example in html you can use colors like `darksalmon`, `mediumvioletred` or `darkslateblue` which I find almost impossible to remeber and work with.

  But in 2014 google presented [Material Design](https://material.io/) and a very good [color palette](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-usage-palettes).

  ## Material design palette

  There are 19 colors with 10 different intensities for each one plus the white and black colors. This gives us 192 different colors ordered in a matrix.

  <div class="w3-center">
    <img src="/static/images/blog/material_colors.svg" alt="material_colors" class="w3-image w3-padding-16"/>
  </div>

  This allows us to use gradients of the same colors like in the following plot
