  ## Table of Contents

  [TOC]

  ## 0. Overview
  
  **Cmder** is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of nice console emulators on Windows.
  It is based on amazing software, and spiced up with the Monokai color scheme and a custom prompt layout, looking sexy from the start.

  ## 1. Instalation

  You can download from the [webpage](https://cmder.net/).
  If you already have git for windows yo can download the mini version.

  After downloading it extract the data and copy it to `C:\Program Files (x86)\cmder_mini`.
  Then open the `.exe` file (`C:\Program Files (x86)\cmder_mini\Cmder.exe`) to start using it.

  ## 2. Setting it as the default terminal

  Open the **cmder** settings wiht `WIN` + `ALT` + `P`.
  Then go to `Integration` / `Default term` and mark `Force conEmu as default terminal for console applications`.

  </div>

  After that any operation that opens the terminal or the powershell will open `cmder`.

  ## 3. Features

  One of the best features is that most linx commands (like `ls`) work here as well as the windows ones (like `dir`).
  So for example, no more problems with `cls` vs `clear` both work here!

  Another really great feature is that you can open multiple consoles as tabs (like with chrome) with `CTRL` + `T` and close it with `CTRL` + `W`.

  It is also way better visually than the default windows terminal.
  And it has git integrations so that you will see by default the branch you are working on.

  </div>

  One other cool feature are alias.
  For example you can write `alias jn=jupyter notebook` and the write `jn` to start jupyter notebooks.

  It has a lot of other nice features, you can read about it in their webpage.
  But the best way would be to install and try it.
